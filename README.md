# shellpower
silly little script I wrote to do some math functions for power consumption of an appliace and how much it costs to run.

Usage:<br />
chmod +x power.sh<br />
./power.sh<br />
and answer it's questions, or else it gets the hose again.

<br />
Example:<br />
How many watts does your device use?:<br />
1213<br />
How many hours are you going to run it?<br />
8<br />
It costs $1.53 to run your 1213 device for 8 hours.<br />
